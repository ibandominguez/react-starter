# react-starter

A minimal react boilerplate for web apps.

## Styling

This starter uses [Radium](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/radium) for styling
so not css loaders have been configured yet

## Getting started

```sh
git clone https://github.com/ibandominguez/react-starter.git
cd react-starter
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open up your browser at http://localhost:8080 and you should see
the app running

## Building for production

```sh
npm run build
```

A build directory is created with the packaged application
ready to be deployed

## Testing

The tools used for tests are *jest* and *enzyme*

* [Jest Documentation](https://facebook.github.io/jest/)
* [Enzyme Documentation](http://airbnb.io/enzyme/)
* [Jest & Enzyme tutorial by Vijay Thirugnanam](https://www.codementor.io/vijayst/unit-testing-react-components-jest-or-enzyme-du1087lh8)

All tests are located in the *tests* directory, to
